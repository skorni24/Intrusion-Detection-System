							<p>With the evolution in wireless
communication, there are many security threats over
the internet. The intrusion detection system (IDS) helps
to find the attacks on the system and the intruders are
detected. Previously various machine learning (ML)
techniques are applied on the IDS and tried to improve
the results on the detection of intruders and to increase
the accuracy of the IDS. This paper has proposed an
approach to develop efficient IDS by using the principal
component analysis (PCA) and the random forest
classification algorithm. Where the PCA will help to
organise the dataset by reducing the dimensionality of
the dataset and the random forest will help in
classification. Results obtained states that the proposed
approach works more efficiently in terms of accuracy as
compared to other techniques like SVM, Na√Øve Bayes,
and Decision Tree. The results obtained by proposed
method are having the values for performance time
(min) is 3.24 minutes, Accuracy rate (%) is 96.78 %,
and the Error rate (%) is 0.21 %.</p>
